# Desktop uploader

This desktop uploader tool provides a drag-and-drop interface for uploading files to the PoC upload endpoint.

It's written in Electron. All code was generated by Claude 3 Opus.

The app does not require any configuration but the user needs to enter the upload URL in the address bar.
